The data consist of 5 lakh of reviews and 74k products with 10 column in which basically i have learnt to do text processing on reviews.
Ultimatly in the given the review it is to be decided whether the review is positive or negative.
It was basically binary classification and and there was a rating section in which if the rating is 4 or 5 then it is considered as a positive review and if rating is 1 or 2 then it is considered as negative review and rating of 3 was neutral.
